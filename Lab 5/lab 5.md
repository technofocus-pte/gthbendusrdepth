**Lab 01- Create a Notebook using Github Copilot chat and provide
answers based on Test dataINTRODUCTION**

This dataset tested\_worldwide.csv is origin from Kaggle. This dataset,
which has the number of tests conducted over time, is important to help
make sense of daily reported cases and understand how COVID-19 is truly
spreading in each country.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  Open Visual Studio Code from the Windows Start menu and open the
    folder navigating to C:\\Labfiles\\CopilotHackathon

your learning.

**EXERCISE**

Our analysis tries to provide an answer to this question: **Which
countries have reported the highest number of positive cases in relation
to the number of tests conducted?**

**Task 1 : Import Required Libraries**
