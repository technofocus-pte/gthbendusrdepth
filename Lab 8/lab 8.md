# **Lab 08 - Develop a chat based on WebSockets using Github Copilot**

## DESCRIPTION

The goal of this challenge is to develop a chat based on websockets. The
chat should allow users to send and receive messages in real time.

(Optional) The chat should also allow users to send and receive images.

(Optional) The chat should keep the session to start again from where it
was left off.

**Practical Copilot Techniques for Visual Studio Code**

-   Open a source file, write a comment description of what you want,
    type &lt;ENTER&gt;, and a suggestion should appear on the following
    line.

    -   If you like the suggestion, hit &lt;TAB&gt; on the keyboard to
        accept.

    -   If the suggestion is unacceptable and you want to type something
        else, type &lt;ESC&gt; on the keyboard to decline the
        suggestion. Then, you may continue typing.

    -   If no suggestion appears, or the suggestion disappears, and you
        want it back, then hit &lt;ALT&gt; + \\ on the keyboard; if
        there is a suggestion, it will appear.

    -   When there are multiple suggestions, to view them,
        type &lt;ALT&gt; + \] or &lt;ALT&gt; + \[ to cycle left and
        right through them. Also, you can hover over the suggestion with
        your mouse cursor to see more.

    -   To view multiple suggestions in a new editor tab,
        type &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;ENTER&gt; to open a new tab and review
        the generated suggestions.

**Useful Copilot Chat Techniques for Visual Studio Code**

-   To open a chat session to discuss a code snippet, highlight the code
    in the editor and type &lt;CTRL&gt;+i on Windows and Linux
    and &lt;CMD&gt;+i on macOS.

-   If you do not understand some lines of code, highlight them,
    right-click, and select Copilot → Explain This from the context
    menu.

-   If you want to fix some lines of code, highlight them, right-click,
    and choose Copilot → Fix This from the context menu.

-   To get help within Copilot Chat, open the chat panel, type in /help,
    and then hit &lt;ENTER&gt;. A good summary of available Copilot Chat
    commands will appear.

-   @&lt;some scope&gt; handles your prompts within a scope; there are
    three scopes: @workspace, @vscode, and @terminal

    -   @workspace is for creating new projects and managing existing
        projects.

    -   @vscode is for editor configuration and managing extensions.

    -   @terminal is for running commands in the terminal.

Copilot does not have access to the file system except for creating a
new project with the @workspace /new command. Copilot does not have
access to your entire solution or other code repositories when making
suggestions via Copilot.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Choose a programming language of your choice.

\- You can use the following API to get a list of random users
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10

\- you can use the following API to get a list of random images
https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=2&limit=100

\- you can use socket.io to implement the chat
https://socket.io/docs/v4/index.html

\- you have an initial index.html file in the root of the project that
you can use as a starting point

### 2. Develop the chat. You can use the following steps as a guide:

\- Allow users to send and receive messages in real time.

\- (Optional) Create a chat with a login screen.

\- (Optional) Allow users to send and receive images.

\- (Optional) Keep the session to start again from where it was left
off.

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {

res.sendFile(\_\_dirname + '/index.html');

});
