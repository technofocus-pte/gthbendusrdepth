**Lab 02 - Build a decision tree classifier based on Scikit-learn and
Python using Github Copilot Chat**

**INTRODUCTION**

diabetes.csv is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney

Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes,

based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Several constraints were placed

on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In
particular, all patients here are females

at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2

From diabetes.csv you can find several variables, some of them are
independent

(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent
variable (Outcome).

**EXERCISE**

The objective of this project is to build a decision tree classifier
based on Scikit-learn and Python. The classifier should be able to
predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on

certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

**Task 2 : Importing Required libraries to build a decision tree
classifier**

1.  Click on Notebook kernel and type !!\# Import the necessary
    libraries, including pandas, sklearn, etc.*!! and* press Enter and
    press tab to accept the code

2.  Press tab. It will take you to the end of the line. Press Enter and
    again press Tab to add all libraries.

*!!\# pandas for data manipulation and analysis!!*

*!!\# matplotlib for data visualization!!*

*!!\# train\_test\_split for splitting the data into training and
testing sets!!*

*!!\# DecisionTreeClassifier for decision tree classification!!*

*!!\# accuracy\_score for evaluating the model!!*

4.  Click on +code to open a new kernel copy the code that was suggested
    by Copilot and run. You can also use the below code to load data.

\# Load the Diabetes Dataset

col\_names = \['pregnant', 'glucose', 'bp', 'skin', 'insulin', 'bmi',
'pedigree', 'age', 'label'\]

\# load dataset

diabetes\_df = pd.read\_csv("diabetes.csv", header=None,
names=col\_names)

\# Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame

diabetes\_df.head()

**Task 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis**

Display the number of rows and columns in the dataframe. Display the
data types of each column. Display the number of missing values in each
column. Display the number of unique values in each column. Display the
basic statistics of each column.

1.  Open a new Code kernel and type !!\#Display the first 5 rows of the
    dataframe!! Press Enter. Press the tab to accept the code. You can
    also use the below code.

> \#Display the first 5 rows of the dataframe
>
> diabetes\_df.head()
